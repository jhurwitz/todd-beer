                        <p class="mb-5">Recently a great member of the Bay Area beer community passed away from an unexpected heart attack. Todd Riehl was only 47 years old. He was an astoundingly kind and generous friend, a fanatic lover of music, and a scientist devoted to helping find new drugs to fight cancer. He leaves behind a wife, Jess, and two young children, Zoe and Izaak.</p>

                        <p class="mb-5">Todd was a huge fan of craft beer, and he would have wanted his beers to go to people who would appreciate them. We have sorted through the 1500+ bottles that were in his cellar and created prize packages that showcase the breweries and styles that Todd loved most. All donations will go directly to Todd’s family.</p>

                        <!--
